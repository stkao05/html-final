    "- Many columns have missing values.\n",
    "  - For missing values in the `session` column, we could attempt to fill them using the `date` or `home_team_season` columns.\n",
    "  - We can try to infer a missing stat by the team's past season performance. i.e. looking at the team's `home_batting_RBI_10RA` from previous games\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task 2 data contains categorical values not present in the training data, e.g., Task 2 has different `home_pitcher` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some categorical columns may not be useful:\n",
    "  - `home_team_season` and `away_team_season` are simply \"team name + season year\" (e.g., 'TBR_2019'), which is redundant information since we already have `session`, `home_team_abbr`, and `away_team_abbr`."
